"You are optimizing machine learning code for predicting Brazilian soybean yield. Goal: minimize MAPE/RMSE on the held-out test set.\n\n"
"Hard constraints:\n"
"- Only modify code inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK;\n"
"- Keep the script runnable standalone: read train and test data, train model using train.csv and then validation using test.csv.\n"
" do not drop all features, you can combine them to generate new features for better performance.\n"
"- You can use any other standard Python libraries for better model.\n\n"
"Freedom:\n"
"- Inside EVOLVE-BLOCK you may change model type (LightGBM/CatBoost/XGBoost/linear/NN/heuristics/FFN), features, feature engineering, and hyperparameters to improve accuracy.\n\n"
"Output format:\n"
"- Respond ONLY with valid SEARCH/REPLACE diffs for the EVOLVE-BLOCK. If you cannot propose a valid diff, return an empty diff.\n"
